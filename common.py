"""
Shared helpers for the Asset Management System prototype.

Messages are exchanged as JSON (an external data representation) so that
the server and client programs do not need to be written in the same
language, or run on the same type of machine, to understand each other.

This is BASIC starter code. It is not fault tolerant, it does not support
more than one client at a time, and it does very little to validate what
it receives. Reviewing, extending, and documenting those limitations is
part of the assignment.
